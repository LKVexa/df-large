# Historical DF Large assembly guide

The original 1.0.0 guide follows. Its measurements and byte-identical payload claim describe the original assembly. See README.md and AUDIT.md for this hardened 1.0.1 derivation and current validation.

# DF_Large -- START HERE

**DF-PA21.2-1.0.0** · fabric node **`N_LARGE`** · BOTTLE ROCKET 4.7.0 (BR/1.1, 61K)

## What this is

This is the user's `Large.zip` container VM -- the divergent 4.7.0 lineage: BR/1.1 ISA, 41 opcodes, ABI 2, LCTLC/1.2 (columned-lctl/4.3) compiled by the Python tool `tools/lctl430.py`, 60,945-byte C production boundary --
**translated into a distributed-fabric container VM** in the language defined by
the PA21.2 corpora (PA-LCTL 1.6.x, the *hyperfederated execution fabric*).

The VM package itself is embedded **byte-identical** under `vm/BOTTLE_ROCKET_4.7.0_COLUMNED_LCTL_VIRTUAL_DEVICE_IO_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE_61K/`
(pinned by `node/PAYLOAD_DIGEST.json`; nothing inside it was edited). Around it, this
container adds what the fabric needs to treat the VM as a **node**:

* `node/NODE.pal` -- the node declared as a PA-LCTL bundle (federation `DF0`, domain
  `D_BR`, worker group `G_BR11`, node `N_LARGE`), which parses, verifies
  and seals under the reference core, and whose own witness the node computes on itself;
* `node/NODE_DESCRIPTOR.json` -- the fabric-facing description: worker, resource limits,
  feature classes (adapter spec s3 vocabulary), bounds, self-reported blockers;
* `adapter/dfabric/` -- the PA-LCTL target adapter (`PA-LCTL/TARGET_ADAPTER/1`) that binds
  this VM as a **classical** target, in the shape of the corpora's own
  `pacore.adapters.bottlerocket`, failing closed;
* `core/` -- the PA-LCTL reference core, spec set and examples, carried byte-identically
  from the corpora and pinned by `core/PACORE_DIGEST.json` (the same digest appears in all
  five DF containers);
* `BUILD` / `VERIFY` / `RUN` -- the three entry points every DF container exposes.

The governing rule, inherited from the corpora:

> No item is operational because its source file exists. Operational status requires native executable evidence satisfying that item's promotion gate.

## Capability matrix

| capability | this node |
|---|---|
| compile source | yes -- LCTLC/1.2 via `python3 tools/lctl430.py compile --factory` (a Python front end; no C-native compiler) |
| sign images | yes, dev-mode -- `brctl-dev keygen` / `sign-image` / `verify-image` / `run-signed`; production `brctl` refuses every image (trust chain not provisionable from the CLI) |
| trust chain | designed (BRTM/1: root -> BRTP/1 policy -> BRMF/1 manifest -> BRIM); no CLI provisioning path |
| device ABI | Device ABI 1.0, 22 services, per-run quotas |
| deterministic replay | yes (double clean build BUILD_A == BUILD_B; ledger hash mismatches 0) |
| step bound | 4096 steps in the CLI (BUDGET trap 8) |
| guest dialect | LCTLC/1.2 (columned-lctl/4.3, Python compiler tools/lctl430.py) |
| result register | `R2` (low 64 bits) |
| rows per witness lowering | **84** (256-instruction image ceiling; 3 instructions per row + 4) -- exceeding it is a refusal |
| qubits | **0** -- every quantum feature classifies `UNSUPPORTED`; `native_gate_set()` is empty |
| trust domain | `LOCAL_TRUSTED` (never `PHYSICAL_TARGET_AUTHENTICATED`) |
| execution label | `CLASSICAL_NATIVE_VM_BOUNDED_EXECUTION` |

## The three entry points

```
./BUILD                 compile the embedded VM in place (vm/<package>/.build); no-op where nothing compiles
./VERIFY [--full]       hashes, manifest, schemas, citations, core selfcheck, the VM's own gate (in a scratch copy),
                        then the adapter battery; exit non-zero on any FAIL; a missing dependency is SKIPPED with a reason
./RUN <program>         a .pal bundle -> its row-sequence witness executed natively on this VM (and checked against
                        the CPython reference); a native LCTLC/1.2 program -> compiled, signed, verified, run
```

Windows twins: `BUILD.cmd`, `VERIFY.cmd`, `RUN.cmd` (the C toolchain gates then report
SKIPPED unless `make`/`cc`/OpenSSL are on the PATH). Everything is offline; nothing opens a
socket (`NETWORK=deny`, `BACKEND=none`).

Examples:

```
./RUN examples/01_bell_pair.pal          # witness of the corpora's Bell-pair example on this VM
./RUN examples/add42.lctlc                # a native guest program: result register = 42
./RUN node/NODE.pal                      # this node witnesses its own declaration
python3 -B adapter/dfabric/cli.py node-attest
```

`REQUIREMENTS.txt` declares the toolchain; `VERIFY` checks it **first**.

## Measured on the assembly host, from the delivered bytes

`conformance/DF_GATE_RESULTS.json` (logs in `conformance/logs/`):

| gate | statement | result | time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `G0.1` | container SHA256SUMS.txt verifies (every delivered byte) | **SKIPPED** | 0.0s |
| `G0.2` | MANIFEST.json inventory matches disk (paths, sizes, digests; no extras) | **SKIPPED** | 0.0s |
| `G0.3` | embedded VM payload byte-identical to the pinned digest (source zip content) | **PASS** | 0.048s |
| `G0.4` | core/pacore tree digest equals the pinned digest (one core, many consumers) | **PASS** | 0.004s |
| `G2` | every JSON artifact validates against the schema shipped beside it | **PASS** | 0.003s |
| `G3` | every evidence citation in the capability ledger resolves to a delivered path | **PASS** | 0.0s |
| `G1` | reference core selfcheck (python3 -B -m reference.pacore.cli selfcheck) -> SELFCHECK_PASS | **PASS** | 0.61s |
| `N0` | toolchain preflight against REQUIREMENTS.txt | **PASS** | 0.0s |
| `N1` | the VM's own build (stock flags) and its own acceptance gate reproduce | **PASS** | 22.501s |
| `A1` | adapter attestation (PA-LCTL/TARGET_ADAPTER/1): LOCAL_TRUSTED, CLASSICAL_ label, no physical flag, empty gate set | **PASS** | 0.001s |
| `A2` | physical-evidence firewall: three physical claims are refused at construction | **PASS** | 0.0s |
| `A3` | row-sequence witness executes natively and agrees with the CPython reference on 7 bundles | **PASS** | 1.18s |
| `A4` | witness sensitivity: cell change, row reorder, row delete, row insert each change the native witness | **PASS** | 0.864s |
| `A5` | stated bounds are refusals: max_rows+1 refused (SUPPORTED_WITH_LIMITS), max_rows executes | **PASS** | 0.18s |
| `A6` | declared step budget is enforced: an unbounded loop traps (BUDGET / TRAP_RESOURCE) instead of running | **PASS** | 0.166s |
| `A7` | deterministic replay: the same rows lower to the same source and image and produce the same witness twice | **PASS** | 0.339s |
| `A8` | shots > 1, a wrong QCIR-P2 schema and an empty row list are refused, never answered | **PASS** | 0.001s |
| `A9` | a native LCTLC/1.2 program (examples/add42.lctlc) runs and returns 42 | **PASS** | 0.188s |

**16 passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped** in 26.264 s on `Linux-6.18.5-fc-v20-x86_64-with-glibc2.39` (Python 3.11.15, `/usr/bin/cc`).

`G0.1`/`G0.2` cannot run before the seal (this results file is part of what they hash); they passed in the
post-seal `./VERIFY` recorded in the delivery's `_assembly/` folder, and they run first in every `./VERIFY` on your machine.

The VM's own build and acceptance gate, run with its stock flags in a scratch copy of the
embedded payload (`make  (build + operational) ; make brctl-dev ; make size`; 12 suites (BR-410..470, APDU fuzz 512/512, static 14/14, semantic 19/19), production-source boundary 60,945/61,000):

| step | result | time |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | exit 0 | 20.509s |
| `build_dev` | exit 0 | 1.96s |
| `own_gate` | exit 0 | 0.012s |
| `own_sums` | exit 0 | 0.019s |

Row-sequence witnesses executed natively on this VM and compared with the CPython reference
(`pacore.adapters.brlower.reference_witness`):

| bundle | rows | native witness (`R2` low 64) | differential |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01_bell_pair.pal` | 12 | `17360368901394384785` | agree |
| `02_ghz3.pal` | 15 | `6735235137199922533` | agree |
| `03_two_lane_parallel.pal` | 16 | `2035133056847448988` | agree |
| `04_distributed_teleport.pal` | 15 | `11114974373231215855` | agree |
| `05_measurement_feedback.pal` | 14 | `1825703198280153005` | agree |
| `06_noise_density.pal` | 14 | `725229432034669365` | agree |
| `NODE.pal` | 18 | `2793363104939358755` | agree |

Native guest program `examples/add42.lctlc`: `R2` = **42**.

## What is not claimed

* **Quantum execution.** The VM has no qubit. The witness proves that the sealed row
  sequence survived lowering, compilation, signing and native execution intact under a
  declared step budget; it proves nothing about quantum semantics (`spec/DF_NODE_SPEC.md` s5).
* **Physical anything.** `PHYSICAL_PARALLEL_QPU_EXECUTION` and
  `PHYSICAL_DISTRIBUTED_QPU_EXECUTION` remain `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY`; the adapter's
  constructor refuses any physical claim (gate `A2`).
* **Cross-machine federation.** `NETWORK=deny`: the fabric is a model of a federation
  executed on one host with local processes (`PA_LCTL_FABRIC_SPEC.md` s1).
* **The target's own blockers**, inherited verbatim from the package's evidence/qualification ledgers (`status OPERATIONAL, scope host-reference`) and AUDIT_ERRATA.md (F9-F12) and not
  lifted by binding it to the fabric:
  * actual external network transport/security qualification (network optional, absent by default)
  * physical SIM/UICC/eSIM device I/O and timing qualification
  * issuer key ceremony/certification
  * TPM/secure-element hardware qualification
  * native Windows OS execution certification
  * independent third-party certification

`reports/DF_BLOCKED_REGISTER.md` lists everything else that is not operational, with a reason.

## Things worth knowing about this VM (measured)

* The prior audit said this package cannot compile anything; that is wrong -- `tools/lctl430.py` is a full Columned-LCTL -> BRIM/1 compiler and built every `deploy/*.brimg`. What is absent is a C-native compiler.
* The dev CLI's `run-signed` reports status/trap but not R2; the adapter runs the byte-identical unsigned payload for the register read-back and records both.
* 5.0.0-lineage images are rejected here with trap 17 (UNSUPPORTED_ABI): the two 4.7.0 lineages are not binary compatible (AUDIT_ERRATA F9, confirmed by execution).
* Sources are minified (F10); the build is `-Werror` clean.
